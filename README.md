This project is an environmental monitoring and control system built on an ESP32 microcontroller. Using the Arduino IDE, we developed a physical prototype to simulate and analyze environmental responses in a controlled chamber.

Real-time Monitoring: The system monitors key environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and air quality, using a DHT22 and an MQ135 sensor.

Automated Control: A real-time feedback control system was developed to automatically regulate the chamber's conditions based on the live sensor data.

This project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software to create an autonomous system for environmental analysis and regulation.

The Arduino IDE source code is provided with the images of project prototype and results.
